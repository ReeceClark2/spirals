Information given:
- Distance to Andromeda
- Angular diameter of Andromeda
- Mass of Andromeda (only for task 1)

Task 1:
- Take radio spectra of galaxies (edge on and maybe others from OPIS section 10)
- Measure red shift of galaxies
- Measure magnitudes of galaxies
- Using apparent magnitude of galaxy, get distance to galaxies (assuming Andromeda-like galaxies)
- Make Hubble diagram of galaxies
- Move galaxy data points horizontally only to best fit line (this should work since the observed red shift is independent of size, but our fit should still be "okay")
- Use these new points to get the true size of the galaxy now correcting for the previous Andromeda-like size assumption
- With the new sizes and Andromeda's mass, get the galaxies' masses
- Calculate the expected velocities of the galaxies' arms and compare to radio spectrum
- Retrieve the calculated inclinations of the galaxies!

Task 2:
- Take optical images of galaxies
- Estimate inclination through observations
- Use the same radio spectra from group 1 to look at horn shape features
- Use the spread of redshifts and estimated inclinations to calculate mass estimates!

Compare the calculated inclinations of group 1 to the optical images of group 2. Compare the mass estimates to the mass estimates of group 1. Finally, compare the mass estimates and inclination estimates to literature values!

Code required:
- Processing and plotting spectra
- Processing and plotting continuum
- Comparing apparent magnitudes of galaxies
- Fetching central redshifts of galaxies
- Plotting Hubble diagram and measuring distance correction to get "true" galaxy sizes
- Fetching galaxies' masses based on relative size to Andromeda
- Calculating expected velocities for those masses
- Comparing calculated velocities to observed velocities to retrieve inclination
- Using horn shape feature, calculate the mass required to get those velocities after optical inclination correction
